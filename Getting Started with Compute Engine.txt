Getting Started with Compute Engine

Objectives
In this lab, you will learn how to perform the following tasks:

Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console.

Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the gcloud command-line interface.

Connect between the two instances.

1.Create an Instance page, for Name, type my-vm-1
2.For Region and Zone, select the region and zone assigned by Qwiklabs.
3.For Machine type, accept the default.
4.For Boot disk, if the Image shown is not Debian GNU/Linux 9 (stretch), click Change and select Debian GNU/Linux 9 (stretch).
5.Leave the defaults for Identity and API access unmodified.
6.For Firewall, click Allow HTTP traffic.
gcloud compute instances create my-vm-1 --zone us-central1-c --image-family debian-9 --image-project debian-cloud

7.Create a virtual machine using the gcloud command line
-Choose a zone from that list other than the zone to which Qwiklabs assigned you
gcloud config set compute/zone us-central1-b 

8.Create a VM instance called my-vm-2
gcloud compute instances create "my-vm-2" \
--machine-type "n1-standard-1" \
--image-project "debian-cloud" \
--image "debian-9-stretch-v20190213" \
--subnet "default"

9.Connect between the two instances
Use the ping command to confirm that my-vm-2 can reach my-vm-1 over the network
- Connect to my-vm-2
  gcloud compute ssh my-vm-2
-Ping my-vm-1 from my-vm-2
 - ping -c 4 my-vm-1
-Use the ssh command to open a command prompt on my-vm-1 from my-vm-2
 ssh my-vm-1
