Getting Started with App Engine

Objectives
In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:

Initialize App Engine.

Preview an App Engine application running locally in Cloud Shell.

Deploy an App Engine application, so that others can reach it.

Disable an App Engine application, when you no longer want it to be visible.

1. Initialize App Engine
- Initialize your App Engine app with your project and choose its region (selected us-west4)
gcloud app create --project=$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID

2. Clone the source code repository for a sample application in the hello_world directory
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples

3. Navigate to the source directory
cd python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world

4. Run Hello World application locally

5. Set up a virtual environment in which you will run your application
sudo apt-get install virtualenv
(If prompted [Y/n], press Y and then Enter)
virtualenv -p python3 venv

6. Activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

7. Navigate to your project directory and install dependencies
pip install  -r requirements.txt

8. Run the application:
python main.py

9. Deploy and run Hello World on App Engine
cd ~/python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world

10. Deploy your Hello World application.
gcloud app deploy
(If prompted "Do you want to continue (Y/n)?", press Y and then Enter)

11. Launch your browser to view the app at http://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com
gcloud app browse
