Getting Started with GKE

1. Confirm that needed APIs are enabled
gcloud services list

2. Start a Kubernetes Engine cluster
- Place the zone that Qwiklabs assigned you to into an environment variable called MY_ZONE. 
export MY_ZONE=
export MY_ZONE=us-central1-a

3. Start a Kubernetes cluster managed by Kubernetes Engine. Name the cluster webfrontend and configure it to run 2 nodes
gcloud container clusters create webfrontend --zone $MY_ZONE --num-nodes 2

4. Check your installed version of Kubernetes
kubectl version

5. View your running nodes in the GCP Console
gcloud container node-pools list --zone us-central1-a --cluster webfrontend	

6. Run and deploy a container
-  launch a single instance of the nginx container
kubectl create deploy nginx --image=nginx:1.17.10

7. View the pod running the nginx container
kubectl get pods

8. Expose the nginx container to the Internet
kubectl expose deployment nginx --port 80 --type LoadBalancer

9. View the new service
kubectl get services

10. Open a new web browser tab and paste your cluster's external IP address into the address bar. The default home page of the Nginx browser is displayed.

11. Scale up the number of pods running on your service
kubectl scale deployment nginx --replicas 3

12. Confirm that Kubernetes has updated the number of pods
kubectl get pods

13. Confirm that your external IP address has not changed
kubectl get services
